# Zalo for Linux 🐧

[![Build Status](https://github.com/doandat943/zalo-for-linux/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/doandat943/zalo-for-linux/actions/workflows/build.yml)

An unofficial, community-driven port of the Zalo desktop application for **Linux only**, created by repackaging the official macOS client into a standard AppImage with integrated ZaDark.

Thanks **realdtn2** for the solution: [realdtn2/zalo-linux-2026](https://github.com/realdtn2/zalo-linux-2026).

## ⚠️ Important: Known Issues

- **✅ Fixed: Can't make or receive calls** - The call module (`zcall`), which only ships as a macOS native binary, now runs under a Wine-based bridge (`zcall-bridge`). Voice calls, video calls (camera) and screen sharing work on Linux. The **Full** AppImage variants bundle Wine + GStreamer out of the box; the standard variants offer a one-click first-run setup. See [`zcall-bridge/README.md`](./zcall-bridge/README.md) for details and system requirements.
- **System/Auto Theme not working:** The app does not follow the system's dark/light mode. Both ZaDark and Zalo ignore `prefers-color-scheme`. See [issue #22](https://github.com/doandat943/zalo-for-linux/issues/22).
- **✅ Fixed: Message Synchronization (E2EE)** - Thanks to [@realdtn2](https://github.com/realdtn2) for reimplementing `db-cross-v4` with C++. E2EE message sync now works on Linux without any Wine workaround. Thanks to [@DMKha2k7](https://github.com/DMKha2k7) for the PR. See [PR #24](https://github.com/doandat943/zalo-for-linux/pull/24) and [issue #15](https://github.com/doandat943/zalo-for-linux/issues/15).
- **✅ Fixed: No Photos/Videos, Files and Links on the Conversation Info panel** - Caused by the missing `db-cross-v4` module.
- **✅ Fixed: Can't see message reactions** - Caused by the missing `db-cross-v4` module.
- **✅ Fixed: Can't paste images from clipboard** - Image files (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, …) can now be pasted into chats via `Ctrl+V`. Works on Wayland (`wl-clipboard`) and X11 (`xclip`). Thanks to [@realdtn2](https://github.com/realdtn2) for the original solution and [@DMKha2k7](https://github.com/DMKha2k7) for the PR. See [PR #25](https://github.com/doandat943/zalo-for-linux/pull/25) and [issue #23](https://github.com/doandat943/zalo-for-linux/issues/23).
- **✅ Fixed: Screenshot without/with Zalo window button** - Uses native Linux screenshot tools (see [issue #19](https://github.com/doandat943/zalo-for-linux/issues/19)). Supported tools: deepin-screen-recorder, spectacle, flameshot, gnome-screenshot, xfce4-screenshooter, mate-screenshot, ksnapshot, scrot. Thanks to [@hthienloc](https://github.com/hthienloc) for the solution.
- **✅ Fixed: No title bar with minimize/maximize/close buttons** - Thanks to [@NanKillBro](https://github.com/NanKillBro) for the solution. For more details, see [issue #4](https://github.com/doandat943/zalo-for-linux/issues/4)
- **✅ Fixed: No tray menu icon**
- **✅ Fixed: Freeze on login screen** - Replaced macOS sqlite3 binaries with native Linux builds. See [issue #13](https://github.com/doandat943/zalo-for-linux/issues/13).

This project is best suited for users who need a native-feeling Zalo client on Linux and are comfortable with the technical workarounds required for full functionality.

## 🧩 Userscripts manager

Open **Settings → Userscripts manager** to create, paste, edit, import, delete,
and enable or disable scripts that run inside Zalo. Tampermonkey-style metadata
such as `@name`, `@description`, `@version`, `@match`, `@include`, and
`@exclude` is recognized. Imported scripts may use the `.js` or `.user.js`
extension.

The compatibility layer currently provides `GM_info`, `GM_addStyle`,
`GM_getValue`, `GM_setValue`, `GM_deleteValue`, `GM_listValues`, and
`unsafeWindow`. Changes take effect the next time the Zalo page is loaded.

> **Security:** Userscripts execute with access to the current Zalo page and
> messages displayed in it. Only install scripts whose source you trust.

## 🌙 ZaDark Integration

> **Note:** ZaDark is licensed under MPL-2.0 and is developed by [Quaric](https://zadark.com). The setup process automatically prepares ZaDark, and build process integrates it seamlessly!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Usage

We strongly recommend using **Gear Lever** to integrate the AppImage perfectly into your system menu.

**Note:** Zalo for Linux comes with a built-in updater. Whenever a new release is available, you will be prompted within the Zalo app to download and apply the update seamlessly without leaving the application.

1.  Download the latest `.AppImage` file from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/doandat943/zalo-for-linux/releases) page.
2.  Install **Gear Lever** from [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en/apps/it.mijorus.gearlever).
3.  Open **Gear Lever**.
4.  Click the **"Open"** button in the top-left corner and select the `.AppImage` file you downloaded.
5.  The app will now appear in Gear Lever. Click the **"Unlock"** button, then choose **"Move to the app menu"** to integrate it into your system's application launcher.

### Native packages

Every release also ships native packages for the **standard variants** — light installers (~200MB). The package manager installs GStreamer (64-bit + 32-bit), Xvfb and the 32-bit libraries from the distro repos, and the **install script downloads the verified wine 11.17 classic** into the app — calls work immediately after install (distro wines are too old — e.g. wine 9.0 on Ubuntu 24.04 — or wow64-only, which breaks video calls; offline installs fall back to the app's first-run download):

- **`.deb`** for Debian/Ubuntu/Linux Mint (needs `universe`)
- **`.rpm`** for Fedora/openSUSE
- **`.pacman`** for Arch (install with `sudo pacman -U <file>`; the `multilib` repo must be enabled)

Both standard variants (with and without ZaDark) are published in all formats. The **Full** variants (call engine bundled inside, works with zero setup on any distro) remain AppImage-only.

### Build from Source

Prerequisites:

- Linux x86_64
- Node.js and npm
- 7z (p7zip-full) for extracting the macOS app during setup
- C++ build tools (for native addons): `build-essential`, `libssl-dev`, `liblzma-dev`
- The `zcall-bridge` call-engine toolchain (see the apt command below)
- `docker` (optional — only for bundling the self-contained 64-bit GStreamer into the **Full** variants; without it the Full AppImage falls back to the host's GStreamer at runtime)

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y p7zip-full build-essential libssl-dev liblzma-dev \
  gcc-mingw-w64-i686 gcc-multilib libc6-dev-i386 libx11-dev libxcb1-dev libxext-dev \
  libx11-dev:i386 libxcb1-dev:i386 libxext-dev:i386 libpipewire-0.3-0 rpm libarchive-tools
```

(`gcc-mingw-w64-i686` builds `pipebridge.exe`; the multilib/i386 X11 dev
packages build the 32-bit `streamproxy.so` capture shim; `libpipewire-0.3-0`
is needed by the bundled-GStreamer self-containment checks.)

Steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/doandat943/zalo-for-linux.git
cd zalo-for-linux
# Then initialize or update submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Run setup + build (downloads DMG, extracts, patches, packages)
npm run main
```

The final AppImage will be in the `dist/` directory.

> variables, and how to add new patches, see

## ⚙️ How It Works

This project is not a from-scratch rewrite of Zalo. It works by:

1.  Downloading the official macOS `.dmg` file.
2.  Using `7z` to extract the `app.asar` archive, which contains the main application logic written in JavaScript.
3.  Removing incompatible native macOS files.
4.  Wrapping the extracted application in a minimal, Linux-compatible Electron shell.
5.  Using `electron-builder` to package everything into a single, portable `AppImage` file.

For a deeper dive into the build pipeline and patching strategy, see
[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

For native addons (db-cross-v4, etc.), see
[`nativelibs/README.md`](./nativelibs/README.md).

## 🐛 Troubleshooting & Debugging

If you encounter issues or want to inspect the app's behavior, you can easily open Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools) using the following methods:
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` while the Zalo window is focused.
- **Tray Menu**: Right-click the Zalo tray icon and select **"Toggle DevTools"**.
